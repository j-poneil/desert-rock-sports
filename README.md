This is one idea for a new website to replace the very aged current one. I don't know if we will actually go with this or not. Maybe something much simpler. I should probably either go all in or SASS or all in for styled-components. Oh well. Very much in progress. Have been working on and off on this for a while without having it on github... but no reason to not have it here, so here it is.

## Technologies
* React ( create-react-app )
* SASS

### Packages
* react-router
* styled-components
* react-responsive-carousel

### Other notes
The images used all pretty much all temporary. Everything will be replaced with better images closer to production.
