This is one idea for a new website to replace the very aged current one. I don't know if we will actually go with this or not. Maybe something much simpler. I should probably either go all in with SASS or all in for styled-components, not mix and match. Oh well. Very much in progress. Have been working on and off on this for a while without having it on github... but no reason to not have it here, so here it is.

## Technologies
* React ( create-react-app )
* SASS

### Packages
* react-router
* styled-components
* react-responsive-carousel

### Other notes
The images used are pretty much temporary. Everything will be replaced with better images closer to production.

( also the image directory is in the .gitignore, so you wont be seeing them anyways )
