// This is the climbing info page for area climbing information. It will have a ton of stuff, so organization and not allowing it to get too hectic will be important.
// I'd kinda like to have some style of climbing specific sections, like cracks, OW, sport multipitch, etc...
    // maybe accordion?

// A section for hiking info too?
// Canyoneering?
// Trail running?
// MTB?
