import React from 'react';

export default function Footer(){
    return (
        <div id="footer">
            {/*
            This footer is displayed on all 'pages'

            I need to change the way it displays.

            I should be able to have it act similarly to the navbar, but different links so the navbar is not as cluttered up.

            This might be good for like:
            area history
            weather
            email
            store address
            */}
            Footer -- Something -- Another -- More
        </div>
    );
}
