Rescues were unavailable.   For those who survived this type of climbing, judgement became an art-form--- or perhaps, even a 6th sense.  Jorge and I settled in Las Vegas in 1974 and were hungry to climb, so we turned to Red Rock’s sandstone which was uncharted territory back then.  These explorations blew our minds --- over and over again --- resulting in many first ascents that are now world-cherished classics:  Frogland, Crimson Chrysalis, Epinephrine, Levitation 29, and others.",
