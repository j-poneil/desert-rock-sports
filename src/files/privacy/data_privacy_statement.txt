We will not sell your email or any data collected about you.

We are only collecting email addresses at this time and would prefer to not collect anything more than that.

We anticipate the bulk of our email contact list to be grown by people filling out the subscription form on our website. We may also do a paper sheet in store which we manually add contacts off of from time to time and then promptly shred up.

We intend to use your email to send you ocassional information on sales, noteworthy new products, noteworthy restocks (ie Totem Cams, climbing or approach shoes), and maybe some notices of Las Vegas local climbing related events.

In very rare circumstances we may message your email directly.
Some possible examples: 
* You were over- or under-charged in store on accident and we know your name as on your credit card, but thats it. We may make an attempt in good-faith to find and contact you to rectify the situation, of course there is no gaurantee that you would even be on our email list in the first place or that your email address is similar enough to your name for us to match them up as a possibility... but maybe!
* We know your name and think you may have accidentally left something in our store but don't have a good way to contact you. (ex. Credit Card, fancy water bottle, cell phone, jacket, hat)
* I don't know, but some other situation that is pretty reasonable.

If we reach out to you directely, it will likely be from redrockguides@gmail.com, which is a shared email we use mainly for coordinating Guided climbing outings, but it is always open in the store and we check it frequently.
